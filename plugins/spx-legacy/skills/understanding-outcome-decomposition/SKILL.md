**OUTCOMES, NOT TASKS.**

This is the most fundamental principle. The Product Tree contains OUTCOMES—states of the world that should exist—not tasks to be done.

| WRONG (Task)                  | RIGHT (Outcome)                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| "Refactor to comply with ADR" | "System produces correct output"          |
| "Fix bug in X"                | "Edge case Y handled correctly"           |
| "Add error handling"          | "Invalid input returns clear error"       |
| "Write tests"                 | Tests are PROOF of outcomes, not outcomes |

**ADRs and PDRs GOVERN, they don't implement.**

- ADR = "when you do X, do it THIS way" — architectural constraints, no outcomes, no work, no tests
- PDR = "the product behaves THIS way" — product behavior constraints, no outcomes, no work, no tests
- NEED comes from stories/features/capabilities — they describe outcomes
- ADR compliance is verified through code review; PDR compliance through product validation

**STORIES REQUIRED FOR IMPLEMENTATION.**

A feature without stories is NOT ready for implementation—regardless of whether code already exists.

- Implementation STARTS at the story level, never at feature level
- Story-level tests provide atomic verification and property-based testing
- Feature-level tests alone are insufficient—they rarely cover edge cases
- **Existing passing tests do not validate missing stories**

```
WRONG: "Implementation exists and passes tests, so flat structure is fine"
RIGHT: "Feature needs stories before any implementation can be verified"

WRONG: "Feature-level tests are comprehensive enough"
RIGHT: "Only story-level tests enable atomic verification and property-based testing"
```

If you encounter a feature with implementation but no stories: **recommend decomposition**, not acceptance.

**SHARED NEED → ENABLER:**

When **2+ containers** share a need, factor it into an ENABLER at the lowest convergence point:

```
54-component-library.capability/
├── 54-fixed-point-format.adr.md       # GOVERNS (no tests here)
├── 21-dsp-foundation.feature/         # ENABLER for shared need
│   └── 21-fixed-point-helpers.story/  # Implements shared helpers
│       └── tests/                     # Tests for the enabler
├── 54-dsp-cordic.feature/             # DEPENDS ON enabler
├── 76-dsp-nco.feature/                # DEPENDS ON enabler
└── 87-dsp-cic.feature/                # DEPENDS ON enabler
```

The ADR (and PDR) doesn't get tests. The ENABLER that satisfies the shared need gets tests.

**The Product Tree replaces the backlog.**

- Writing a spec = creating potential energy (a state that should exist)
- Passing tests = realizing potential (proving the state exists)
- The tree grows coherently—ideas must connect to existing structure

**Structured Outcome Requirement:**

> Every outcome must be expressed as a typed, structured outcome (Scenario, Mapping, Conformance, or Property), have referenced test files, and pass agentic review. This is the quality gate — not syntactic constraints, but verified coherence between specs, tests, and passing tests.

Note: ADRs and PDRs don't have outcomes—they GOVERN. The requirement applies to outcomes in specs. See `references/outcome-types.md` for the four outcome types and their notations.

**Principle 11:**

> Higher levels unaware of lower level breakdown. Features don't list story outcomes. Capabilities don't list feature outcomes. Completion bubbles up through test results, not spec references.

<quick_start>
This skill provides mental models for Outcome Engineering decomposition. Read it BEFORE using:

- `/decomposing-prd-to-capabilities`
- `/decomposing-capability-to-features`
- `/decomposing-feature-to-stories`

Key questions for each level:

| Level          | Question                                            | Constraint                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Capability** | "What can the product DO?"                          | Cross-cutting vertical slice |
| **Feature**    | "What significant slice can be done in ≤7 stories?" | At most 7 atomic stories     |
| **Story**      | "What's the atomic unit?"                           | Structured outcomes          |

</quick_start>

<level_semantics>

<capability_level>

## Capability: What the Product CAN DO

A capability is a **large, cross-cutting vertical slice** of the product. It represents something the product is capable of doing, providing, or accomplishing.

**Examples:**

- "Document Generation"
- "Custody Account Management"
- "Monetization Platform"
- "Identity and Authentication Management"

**Key characteristics:**

- May be involved in one, many, or ALL customer journeys
- Represents a coherent area of product functionality
- Can start with a single feature and grow
- Up to 9 sibling capabilities (BSP numbering)

**NOT a capability:**

- A single API endpoint (too small → feature or story)
- A customer journey (journeys may span multiple capabilities)
- An implementation detail (belongs in story)

</capability_level>

<feature_level>

## Feature: Significant Vertical Slice (≤7 Stories)

A feature is a **significant and valuable vertical slice** that can be implemented in at most 7 atomic stories.

**Examples:**

- "Stable Diffusion Generation"
- "User Auth" or more specifically "Password Auth" vs "Magic Link Auth"
- "User Lifecycle Management"
- "Export Documents"
- "Save Files to Cloud Storage"

**The 7-story limit is critical:**

```
IF feature needs > 7 stories
THEN split into multiple features

IF feature has only 1-2 stories
THEN it may be too small (or that's fine for now—it can grow)
```

**Key characteristics:**

- Implementable in at most 7 atomic stories
- Represents significant user value
- Can start with a single story and grow
- Up to 9 sibling features per capability

**NOT a feature:**

- A single function or method (too small → story)
- An entire product area (too large → capability)
- A technical task with no user value (may not belong in the tree at all)

</feature_level>

<story_level>

## Story: Atomic Implementation Unit

A story is the **atomic unit of implementation**—something that can be understood and implemented as a single coherent piece.

**Examples:**

- "Reset password"
- "Send reset password email"
- "Parse SPI configuration"
- "Generate Verilog for SPI master"

**The level of abstraction depends on context:**

- In a simple auth system: "Reset password" might be one story
- In a complex auth system: "Send reset password email" and "Validate reset token" might be separate stories

**Key characteristics:**

- Expressible as structured outcomes (Scenario, Mapping, Conformance, or Property)
- Atomic—can be implemented without partial states
- Has clear acceptance criteria
- Up to 9 sibling stories per feature (but aim for ≤7)

**NOT a story:**

- Multiple unrelated behaviors (split into separate stories)
- Vague requirements (not ready for engineering—needs discovery)
- Technical tasks without user-facing behavior (may be part of a story, not a separate one)

</story_level>

</level_semantics>

<organic_growth>

## The Tree Grows Organically

**Starting small is normal:**

```
21-auth.capability/
└── 21-login.feature/
    └── 21-basic-login.story/
```

This is a valid structure. One capability, one feature, one story.

**Growth happens at any level:**

```
21-auth.capability/
├── 21-login.feature/
│   ├── 21-basic-login.story/
│   ├── 37-remember-me.story/        ← Story added
│   └── 54-login-throttling.story/   ← Story added
├── 37-registration.feature/          ← Feature added
│   └── 21-email-registration.story/
└── 54-password-reset.feature/        ← Feature added
    ├── 21-request-reset.story/
    └── 37-complete-reset.story/
```

**BSP numbering enables insertion:**

- Lower BSP = dependency (must be done first)
- Same BSP = parallel (can be done concurrently)
- Higher BSP = dependent (depends on lower numbers)

</organic_growth>

<decomposition_principles>

## How to Decompose

**Capability → Features:**

Ask: "What significant vertical slices make up this capability?"

Each slice should be:

- Independently valuable
- Implementable in ≤7 stories
- A coherent unit of functionality

**Feature → Stories:**

Ask: "What atomic pieces make up this feature?"

Each piece should be:

- Expressible as a structured outcome
- Implementable as a single unit
- Clearly testable

**The key question at every level:**

> Can this be expressed as a structured outcome (Scenario, Mapping, Conformance, or Property)? If not, decompose further or clarify requirements.

<common_mistakes>

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Putting Story-Level Outcomes in Features

**Wrong** (the SPI example):

```markdown
# Feature: Serial SPI

## Outcomes

### 1. SPI master transmits in mode 0 ← Should be a story

### 2. SPI modes 1-3 verified ← Should be a story

### 3. SPI slave responds ← Should be a story

### 4. Master-slave loopback works ← Feature-level OK

### 5. Lint-clean HDL ← Feature-level OK
```

**Correct structure:**

```
22-serial-spi.feature/
├── serial-spi.feature.md       # Outcomes 4 & 5 only (if needed)
├── 10-spi-master.story/        # Outcomes 1 & 2 become stories
├── 20-spi-slave.story/         # Outcome 3 becomes a story
└── ...
```

**Why?** Principle 11—features don't list story outcomes. Stories prove themselves through passing tests.

### Mistake 2: Features with >7 Stories

If you need 12 stories, you have 2 features, not 1.

### Mistake 3: Confusing Test Levels with Container Levels

Test levels (1, 2, 3) are about **infrastructure needed**:

- Level 1: No real infra (DI, temp dirs)
- Level 2: Real binaries/databases
- Level 3: Real services/credentials

Container levels (Story, Feature, Capability) are about **scope of concern**:

- Story: Atomic implementation
- Feature: ≤7 stories as a significant slice
- Capability: Cross-cutting product ability

**These are orthogonal.** A story can have Level 2 tests. A capability can have Level 1 tests.

### Mistake 4: Removing All Outcomes from Features

**WRONG:** Agents removing ALL outcomes from features because "features don't list story outcomes."

**Features MUST have their own outcomes.** Principle 11 means features don't list outcomes that ARE stories (atomic implementation units). Features still have:

- **Integration outcomes**: Scenarios where multiple stories work together
- **Quality gates**: Cross-cutting verification (lint-clean, synthesizable)
- **End-to-end scenarios**: Complete feature workflows

```markdown
# Feature: Serial SPI

## Outcomes

### 1. Master-slave loopback works ← KEEP (integration)

### 2. Generated HDL passes lint ← KEEP (quality gate)
```

What to MOVE to stories:

```markdown
### 3. SPI master mode 0 works ← MOVE TO STORY (atomic)
```

### Mistake 5: Treating ADRs/PDRs as Implementation

**WRONG:** "Where do we test the ADR?" or "ADR compliance story"

**ADRs and PDRs GOVERN, they don't implement:**

- ADRs/PDRs create NO work, NO outcomes, NO tests
- NEED comes from stories/features/capabilities
- ADR compliance verified through code review; PDR compliance through product validation

**The ENABLER pattern for shared needs:**

```
WRONG:
54-component-library.capability/
├── 54-fixed-point-format.adr.md
└── tests/
    └── test_adr_compliance.py    ← ADRs don't get tests!

RIGHT:
54-component-library.capability/
├── 54-fixed-point-format.adr.md       # GOVERNS (no tests)
├── 21-dsp-foundation.feature/         # ENABLER (has the NEED)
│   └── 21-fixed-point-helpers.story/  # Satisfies shared need
│       └── tests/                     # Tests verify outcomes
├── 54-dsp-cordic.feature/             # Uses enabler
└── 76-dsp-nco.feature/                # Uses enabler
```

### Mistake 6: Assuming Existing Implementation Validates Missing Stories

**WRONG reasoning:**

```
"Implementation exists and is functional"
"Tests are comprehensive"
"Structure is flat - all tests at feature level"
"This may be intentional for a completed feature"
```

**Why this is wrong:**

1. **Existence of code doesn't validate structure** - The Outcome Engineering framework requires stories regardless of implementation state
2. **Feature-level tests are never "comprehensive enough"** - They rarely do property-based testing, edge case coverage, or atomic verification
3. **"Flat structure works" is backlog thinking** - Specs are permanent documentation, not work tracking
4. **Completed ≠ correctly structured** - Legacy code often lacks proper decomposition

**RIGHT response when finding implementation without stories:**

```
"Feature has implementation but no stories. This violates Outcome Engineering framework.
Recommend decomposing into stories to enable:
- Atomic verification of each behavior
- Property-based testing at story level
- Clear specification of edge cases
- Independent verification of each unit"
```

**The test:** If a feature has `tests/` but no `*.story/` directories, it needs decomposition—regardless of whether tests pass.

## What Goes Where (Summary)

| Type     | Purpose                | Contains                       | Verified by                          |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **ADR**  | GOVERNS how (arch)     | Constraints, rationale         | `/reviewing-{language}-architecture` |
| **PDR**  | GOVERNS what (product) | Product invariants             | Product/UX review                    |
| **Spec** | DESCRIBES outcomes     | Structured outcomes, test refs | `/reviewing-{language}`              |
| **Test** | PROVES existence       | Executable verification        | `/reviewing-{language}-tests`        |

**The Flow:**

```
ADR/PDR constrains → Spec defines WHAT → Test PROVES → Ledger RECORDS
```
